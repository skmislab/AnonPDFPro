# AnonPDF Pro

AnonPDF Pro is a Windows (WinForms) application for PDF anonymization. It lets you redact document areas, remove pages, add text annotations, and search for content to mark quickly. For image-only regions with no text, it can fall back to OCR (Tesseract) for searching.

## Features
- Rectangular area selection and redaction.
- Remove single pages or page ranges.
- Text annotations with configurable font and position.
- Text search and conversion of results into selections.
- Display and report of digital signature status.

## Requirements & Build
- Visual Studio 2019+ (Windows); target .NET Framework as defined by the project.

**First time setup:**
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `restore-packages.bat` (recommended) OR `nuget restore AnonPDFPro.sln -PackagesDirectory packages`
   - This ensures packages are restored to the local `packages/` folder
   - Required for native PDFium DLLs to be copied correctly during build
3. Open `AnonPDFPro.sln` in Visual Studio
4. Build and run (F5)

**Alternative - Command line build:**
- Restore: `nuget restore AnonPDFPro.sln -PackagesDirectory packages`
- Build: `msbuild AnonPDFPro.sln /p:Configuration=Release`
- Run: `bin\Release\AnonPDFPro.exe`

**Note:** The `NuGet.Config` file ensures packages are restored locally to `packages/` folder, which is required for native DLLs (pdfium_x64.dll, Tesseract data files) to be copied to the build output.

The help file `UserGuide_*.pdf` is copied to the output (bin) directory during build.

## WinForms Designer DPI
- When opening `PDFForm.cs` in the designer on a 150% scaled display, Visual Studio may warn about DPI and adjust layout.
- To avoid unintended `.Designer.cs` changes, use a 100% scaled display or temporarily switch scaling to 100% while editing.

## Debugging in Visual Studio (iText `FontCache` NullReferenceException)

When debugging AnonPDF Pro in Visual Studio, you may see the debugger break with an exception similar to:

> System.NullReferenceException  
> Source = itext.io  
> at iText.IO.Font.FontCache..cctor()

This typically happens when working with signed PDFs (e.g. when calling `SignatureUtil`) and is caused by internal initialization logic in iText.  
The exception is **handled internally by iText** and does **not** indicate a real error in AnonPDF Pro, but Visual Studio may still break on it by default.

If this keeps interrupting your debugging session, you can safely adjust your debugger settings:

1. In Visual Studio, go to  
   **Tools -> Options -> Debugging -> General**
2. Make sure:
   - **Enable Just My Code** is **checked**.
   - You do **not** have a global setting that breaks on **all** thrown CLR exceptions.
3. Optionally, open the **Exception Settings** window and uncheck  
   **Break when thrown** for **Common Language Runtime Exceptions**.

After these changes, the internal iText `FontCache` exception will no longer stop the debugger, while AnonPDF Pro will continue to run normally.

## Usage
- Open a PDF and navigate pages.
- Draw redaction areas, add annotations, remove pages.
- Save the new PDF and optionally open it after saving.
